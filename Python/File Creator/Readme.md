# File Creator 
To use, You have to run it in the terminal, i recommend saving the file in the home folder, as you save time by not having to cd where it is, i already added the shebang in the file, so you can just simply un "chmod u+x filecreator.py" and then use ./filecreator.py
This is something i made just to save time typing, i hope you enjoy using it!
